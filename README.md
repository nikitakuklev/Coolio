## Coolio
Arduino firmware for 'smart' 8 channel fireplace fan controller with IR temperature feedback

### Purpose/How it works
This code is for the coolio arduino project, which aims to add dynamically controlled fan array to an old fireplace, improving its efficiency. Any 4 wire PWM fans should work (author used the nicely priced Arctic Cooling 120mm jumbo packs). See hardware folder for Autodesk Inventor designs.

### How to build
Open main file (cooliovX.ino) in Arduino IDE, then build and upload
